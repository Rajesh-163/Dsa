Cloud Hosting Solution â€“ Backend (Java Spring Boot)

A Vercel-like cloud hosting solution with backend services in Java Spring Boot.

1. High-Level Architecture


Frontend: Next.js with TypeScript
Backend: Java Spring Boot (API, authentication, deployment management)
Database: PostgreSQL & ClickHouse
Messaging Queue: Kafka (for log retrieval)
Containerization: Docker
Orchestration: AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)
Storage: AWS S3 (for asset files)
Authentication: NextAuth with OAuth
ORM: Prisma (for frontend) & JPA/Hibernate (for backend)

2. Step-by-Step Roadmap
Phase 1: Project Setup
Initialize Backend Project


Create a Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr.
Include dependencies:
Spring Web (for REST APIs)
Spring Security (for authentication)
Spring Data JPA (for database access)
PostgreSQL driver
Kafka dependencies
Set Up Database


Configure PostgreSQL database in application.properties.
Set up entity classes and repositories with JPA.
Set Up Kafka


Install Kafka & configure Kafka Producer and Consumer for handling logs.
Implement Authentication


Use Spring Security + OAuth2 integration.
Implement JWT-based authentication if needed.

Phase 2: Core Features
Deployment Management


Create APIs for users to upload projects.
Store project metadata in the database.
Containerization & Orchestration


Create Dockerfiles for packaging user projects.
Implement an AWS ECS integration for containerized deployment.
File Storage with AWS S3


Configure AWS SDK in Spring Boot.
Develop APIs for file uploads to S3.

Phase 3: Observability & Finalization
Logging & Monitoring


Implement centralized logging using Kafka.
Set up monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana.
Deployment & CI/CD


Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
Deploy backend services to AWS ECS.

Next Steps
